# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

While studying machine learning, I completed the following project. In this small project I tried to create a model to predict if a hotel reservation would be canceled based on past reservation data. I used tools like pandas and scikit-learn.

To find the best accuracy, I compared a Logistic Regression model with a Random Forest model. The difference was around 0.75 for Logistic Regression versus 0.81 for Random Forest.
