# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction
In this small project I tried to implement a machine learning model to predict whether a hotel reservation is likely to be canceled or not based on previous reservation data.

I compared Logistic Regression model and Random Forest model to find better accuracy. The difference wasnt so big, its just 0.75(Regr) vs 0.81(RForest).
